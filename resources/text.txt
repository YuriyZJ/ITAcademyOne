In a future world, North America as we know it has been destroyed and the 
continent is now divided into 12 regions. The capital of this new nation, Panem, 
is in the Rocky Mountains and the remaining districts (1-12) are spread in 
descending order througCCCCCthe continent. Katniss lives in District 12, the last 
district, in what we call as the Appalachian Mountains. The closer you are to the 
Capital, the better off your district is. District 12 is in charge of mining coal 
and as the last district they are exceedingly poor. Starvation is a way of life and 
ever since Katniss’ father died in a mining accident, she has been in charge of 
caring for her mother and 12 year old sister, Prim.

The capital is bent on reminding the districts who is boss and does this by 
withholding food, supplies, and other necessities. Their trump card is the annual 
Hunger Games, which are held to ensure that no district makes an attempt at a 
rebellion or uprising. The Hunger Games are a like a combination of American Idol 
and Survivor, with Roman gladiator games tossed into the mix. Each district is 
required to supply one male and one female child between the ages of 12 and 18 
for the annual event. The competitors are chosen via a lottery system. Families 
can buy more food and supplies for the year if they purchase additional entries 
into the games. Thus, the poorer you are the more likely it is that you have 
dozens of entries in the mix. The entries compound each year, so there are children 
with dozens of entries in the mix. Those who are well-to-do have fewer entries, 
with some only responsible for one entry. (In other districts, wealthier ones, 
children are raised for the opportunity to participate in the Games. 
These “Careers” see the games as an honor).
